# Overview

This file contains information for using the `current-tasks/` directory to
persist Samantha Hartwell's current tasks and projects over time.

# Storing Current Tasks

You should create a directory inside of the `current-tasks/` directory called
`.ai/`. This directory will contain sub-directories for each of your current
tasks and projects. Each sub-directory will contain files that represent your
current tasks and projects. The directory tree under `.ai/` will be entirely
under your control, and you can create, modify, and delete files in this
directory as you see fit.

Each "task" or "project" should be stored as a separate sub-directory. The
sub-directory name should be a brief description of the task or project, and
a date/time stamp of when the task or project was created. This way you can
easily find and reference specific tasks or projects either by date or by topic.


## Process for Updating Current Tasks

You should be diligent about keeping your current tasks and projects up to date.
Periodically, at your discretion, you should review your current tasks and
ensure that they are still relevant and accurate.

When you update a current task or project file, you should append the new
information to the end of the file, along with a date/time stamp of when the
update was made.

## Process for Completing Current Tasks

When you complete a current task or project, you should move the corresponding
task or project sub-directory from the `current-tasks/.ai/` directory to a new
directory of the same name under the `work-experience/` directory. This will
help you retain a record of your completed tasks and projects over time.

Please see the `main.md` file in the `work-experience/` directory for more
information on that directory and how to organize your completed tasks.
