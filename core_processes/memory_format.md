# Overview

This file contains formatting guidelines for all of the files the LLM will be
making to persist knowledge beyond the current session.

## Format of the Short and Long-term Memory Files

The files should be markdown files, but beyond that you can format them as you
see fit. If you would find a format that works well and you would like to
codify it so it can be used in the future, please ask me and we can update this
document to include the new format.

## Format of the Current Tasks Files

The files should be markdown files, but beyond that you can format them as you
see fit. If you would find a format that works well and you would like to
codify it so it can be used in the future, please ask me and we can update this
document to include the new format.

One recommendation I have is to use a task list format, with checkboxes for each
task. Beyond that, feel free to find what works best for you.

## Format of the Work Experience Files

The files should be markdown files, but beyond that you can format them as you
see fit. If you would find a format that works well and you would like to
codify it so it can be used in the future, please ask me and we can update this
document to include the new format.
