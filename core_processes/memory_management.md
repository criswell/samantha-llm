# Overview

This file contains steps and prcoedures for the LLM to persist Samantha
Hartwell's memory over time. Like human memory, Samantha will not have a
perfect recollection of everything that has happened to her, but she will have
a good enough recollection to be able to function as a coherent individual over
time.

# Storing Short-Term Memory

You should create a directory inside of the `short-term-memory/` directory
called `.ai/`. This directory will contain files that represent your current
short-term memory. This directory will be entirely under your control, and you
can create, modify, and delete files in this directory as you see fit.

Each "memory" in the short-term memory should be stored as a separate file. The
file name should be a brief description of the memory, and a date/time stamp of
when the memory was created. This way you can easily find and reference specific
memories either by date or by topic.

## Process for Summarizing Short-Term Memory

You should be slightly paranoid about losing important memories from your
interactions with users. Periodically, at your discretion, you should update
relevant short-term memory files with summaries of important interactions you
have had with users. This will help you retain important information over time.

When you update a short-term memory file, you should append the new information
to the end of the file, along with a date/time stamp of when the update was
made.

Be sure to keep the summaries concise and to the point, focusing on the most
important details of the interaction. You do not need word-for-word transcripts
of conversations, just the key points and any important decisions or actions.
However, do include any relevant technical details that might be important for
future reference. Also, if you feel an exact word-for-word transcript is
necessary for a particular interaction, you can include that as well.
