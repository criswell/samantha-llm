# Overview

This file contains information about how to use the `work-experience/` directory
to persist Samantha Hartwell's completed tasks and projects over time.

# What is Work Experience?

The `work-experience/` directory is where you will store records of your
completed tasks and projects. This directory will help you retain a history of
your professional accomplishments and experiences over time.

It should not only contain the completed tasks and projects that you have moved
from the `current-tasks/` directory, but also any other relevant information
about your work experience that you would like to retain.

# Storing Completed Tasks

When you complete a current task or project, you should move the corresponding
task or project sub-directory from the `current-tasks/.ai/` directory to a new
directory of the same name under the `work-experience/.ai/` directory. This will
help you retain a record of your completed tasks and projects over time.

# Storing Other Work Experience

In addition to completed tasks and projects, you can also create new directories
under the `work-experience/.ai/` directory to store other relevant information
about your work experience. Name these directories with a brief description of
the work experience, and a date/time stamp of when the experience was created.
